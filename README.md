# DataStructures

#Welcome to my (OTHS) Computer Science Data Structures GitHub repository! Here, I've compiled a diverse set of data structure implementations, covering topics like file I/O, generics, inheritance, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and sorting algorithms. Each assignment is thoughtfully organized with details including scores, submission dates, and due dates. Whether you're a fellow student keeping tabs on grades or a developer keen on exploring various data structures, this repository serves as a centralized hub for all things related. Contributions are more than welcome â€“ feel free to add your own implementations, assignments, or enhancements to the existing code. Come on in and delve into the fascinating world of computer science data structures!
